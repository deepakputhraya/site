I am an engineer at [Harness](https://harness.io) where I work on our CD platform. I have helped integrate third party builds systems with Harness and I am currently working on building a tool to help migrate customers from our first generation CD to our next generation CD. I'm a strong believer that developers shouldn't be spending too much time thinking about infrastructure, that is one of the reasons I joined Harness. Prior to Harness I worked at [Playment](https://playment.io) where I helped design & build their computer vision tools. I love to tinker with new technologies and I am currently trying to learn Rust. 

Having written software professionally on nodeJS, Python and Java, I have little doubt that powerfully type-safe languages which expose more problems at compile time are the future.
These days I'm especially interested in ways to improve the robustness and longevity of software, and reduce toil in operating it.

If you are building software for developers, I would love to talk to you.

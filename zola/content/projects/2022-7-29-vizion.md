Vizion is an easy-to-use desktop Mac OCR app that can extract and recognize any non-searchable and non-editable text on your Mac's screen. It is a super convenient alternative to complicated optical character recognition tools.

Select with a mouse any part of an image, photo, PDF document, or anything on your screen, and the app will recognize any text within this selection. The text output will be saved into a clipboard, so you could paste it into your favorite note-taking software.

### Use Cases
- Read text from images, PDF documents, photos, Zoom meetings, or any other sources.
- Copy text even when it is uncopiable like in ebooks or web articles.
- Scan QR or barcodes.

### Features
- Vizion doesn't need an internet connection to process documents.
- Scan QR or barcodes from images, documents, websites & other sources.
- Recognizes even tiny text on images with low quality or dense background.
- Clipboard history of all the texts captured using Vizion.

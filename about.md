I am an engineer at Playment where I help design, build, run our API and maintain our crowd-sourcing platform. I have helped setup and manage Playment's Infrastructure, setup CI/CD so that developers spend as little time on worrying about maintaining infrastructure.
I'm a strong believer that developers shouldn't be spending too much time thinking about infrastructure.

Having written software professionally on nodeJS, Python and Java, I have little doubt that powerfully type-safe languages which expose more problems at compile time are the future.
These days I'm especially interested in ways to improve the robustness and longevity of software, and reduce toil in operating it.
